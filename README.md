# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Start the program
### Step 2: 
This line assigns values to four variables : x1,x2,y1 and y2.This variables represent the coordinates of two points in a 2D plane.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
This line points the calculated distance,rounded to two decimal places,using the round function.
### Step 5: 
This  program calculates and prints the distance between the points(10,6) and (4,2) in a 2D plane.
### Step 6:
End the program.0
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1,x2,y1,y2 = 10,4,6,2
dis= math.sqrt((pow((x2-x1),2)+pow((y2-y1),2)))
print(round(dis,2))eexex

```
  ### OUTPUT:
